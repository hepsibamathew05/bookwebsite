**Epeolarty Book Store**
Welcome to Epeolarty Book Store! This project is a web application where users can browse books by genre (e.g., fiction, thriller, romance), manage their personal collections in "My Books," connect with friends, participate in group discussions, and send messages.

This is a small project designed to demonstrate the core features of a book browsing and social platform. Users can click on book images to read sample content, though currently, this is a basic design with limited functionality. The project is still in development, with only a few options fully functional, serving as a demo of the full experience planned.
